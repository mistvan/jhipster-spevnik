This is my [C]song, it's not very [C/E]good
the words don't make [F]sense, the lyrics don't [G]rhyme.

It's only to [Am7]test my [F]program to [C/E]see if it [F]works
I [Dm7]hope it [F]does or [Gsus4]else I'll [G]be [C]sad.

[F]This is the [C]chorus, [G]that was the [C]verse.
[F]Lalala[C]la[G7]la[C]la[F]la[G]lala[C]la.
